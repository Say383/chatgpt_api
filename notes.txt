engine: The davinci-codex engine is designed for code generation and is the most powerful engine available for this type of task.
prompt: The prompt is a clear and concise description of the problem we want to solve. It's important to phrase the prompt in a way that GPT-3 can understand and provide an accurate response.
max_tokens: The max_tokens parameter controls the maximum length of the generated text in tokens (words or punctuation marks). In this example, we set it to 1024 to allow for longer code samples.
n: The n parameter specifies how many responses we want to generate. In this example, we set it to 1 to get a single Python function as the output.
stop: The stop parameter is used to specify a sequence of tokens at which the API should stop generating text. In this example, we set it to None to allow the API to generate the entire function.
temperature: The temperature parameter controls the creativity or randomness of the generated text. In this example, we set it to 0.5 to balance creativity with fidelity to the prompt.
frequency_penalty: The frequency_penalty parameter can be used to discourage the API from repeating the same phrases or patterns in the generated text. In this example, we set it to 0 to allow for some repetition.
presence_penalty: The presence_penalty parameter can be used to discourage the API from generating text that doesn't match the prompt. In this example, we set it to 0 to allow for more creativity in the generated code.
model: The model parameter specifies the name of the language model we want to use. In this example, we're using the text-davinci-002 model, which is a variant of the davinci model optimized for natural language tasks.
